Analyzing Real-World Corporate Email Data: a Social Network Modeling Approach to Understand Organizational Communication
[Python: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Sklearn, NetworkX]


This project for my master thesis presents an in-depth exploration of organizational communication networks through the lens of Social Network Analysis (SNA) and Machine Learning techniques, specifically focusing on the intricate dynamics of digital communication, such as emails, within a Partner Research Company. The
study embarks on a methodological journey comprising three pivotal experiments, each designed to peel back layers of complexity within organizational
interactions and their implications for performance and engagement. The first experiment employs centrality measures to pinpoint key individuals within the network, highlighting the significant yet multifaceted roles of managers and select employees. This phase underscores the importance of both hierarchical positions and the density and quality of interactions in determining an individual’s influence within the organization. In the second experiment, clustering analysis is utilized to distinguish various communication personas, shedding light on the diverse communication patterns that pervade the company. This segmentation offers actionable insights, enabling the customization of engagement strategies to accommodate different communication styles, thereby bolstering organizational effectiveness. The third experiment ventures into predictive modeling, using regression and classification approaches to forecast performance and work engagement
of the employees. Despite a methodical feature selection and analysis process, the models reveal limitations in their predictive power, particularly concerning Work Engagement. This outcome suggests a need for enhanced data collection methodologies to more accurately capture the spectrum of Work Engagement values. The thesis culminates in a reflection on the broader implications of these findings for organizational communication networks. Despite encountering certain limitations, particularly in data representation and the modeling of non-linear relationships, the research paves the way for future inquiries. It proposes a multidisciplinary approach for further exploration, combining data science, organizational psychology, and communication studies to decode the complex web of interactions that underpin organizational life. Through this scholarly endeavor, the thesis contributes to both academic discourse in organizational behavior and network science, and offers pragmatic insights for improving communication dynamics within organizations. The fusion of theoretical constructs and practical applications within this research underscores the transformative potential of SNA and machine learning in driving organizational innovation and effectiveness. 



• Conducted Social Network Analysis on Partner Research Company's internal communications, applying K-means clustering, validated with Gaussian Mixture Models, to categorize communication profiles.

• Deployed Partial Least Squares Regression and Random Forest Classification to develop predictive models for the level of employee engagement and performance classes explaining a low yet significative 10% of the variance.

• Achieved 40% performance optimization in models, quantified by MSE reduction of 15% and accuracy increase of 25%, from 70% focusing on outlier detection using percentage error approach and IQR analysis and 30% via Boxcox transformation and sampling strategies to rectify dataset imbalances.
